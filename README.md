## No longer maintained
This repository has been deprecated and is superceded by [WordPress Composer Managed](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wordpress-composer-managed).

## Local development

The `/packages/` directory can be used as a local path repository if you want to do development on any of the `pantheon-systems` packages included in this project. Simply `git clone` any dependency package into `/packages/` and then `composer update` will use your local versions rather than the public ones managed by Packagist.
